# MM-Task

Hi, I'll try to provide more details about the project here. I have tried to add comments in the code as much as possible. I hope you like it, and any feedback is appreciated! 

Cheers, 
Burak.

## ðŸ“œGeneral info
- All C++ files have **MM** prefix.
- C++ Interfaces have **Interface** suffix.
- C++ classes are not directly used in the project. BP children are created and used.
- Blueprints, Maps and Widgets are under `/Content/Task/` folder.
- I used C++ for the core logic, but used Blueprints for the interaction/communication, and also in the widgets.
- Some functions are exposed to Blueprints and called from there as well.
- I used interfaces to make communication between classes more extendeable and flexible.
- You can play it on standalone net mode.
